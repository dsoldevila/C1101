**Working on it, not reeady yet.**

CC1101 Driver for STM32.

This driver has been tested with STM32F446ZETx (NUCLEO F446ZE) and STM32F446RETx, but should be compatible with any STM32 board and should be easily portable to any board with an SPI interface.

Based on the work of https://github.com/SpaceTeddy/CC1101

# C1101

This code is based on the code made by SpaceTeddy (https://github.com/SpaceTeddy/CC1101).

GNURadio/float2bits.py made by Mike Czumak (https://www.securitysift.com/ook-signal-decoding-replay)

**Not finished yet.**

I'm uploading the whole project, but the interesting files are:
  * Src/rf_driver.c
  * Include/rf_driver.h
  * GNURadio directory
